*Starborn* is a short interactive sci-fi story.

There are two versions: the original [Inform 7](http://inform7.com) version (2011) has a parser that has the reader type in keywords to advance the story. The [Vorple](http://vorple-if.com)-enhanced [Undum](http://undum.com) version (2012) is identical in content but has a clickable keywords and a map.

Both versions are playable online:

 * [Inform 7 version](http://parchment.game-testing.org/play/parchment.full.html?story=http://starborn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Starborn.z8)
 * [Undum version](http://transcripts.game-testing.org/undum/starborn/)

The Inform 7 version can be played online. Installation instructions can be found at the [Interactive Fiction Database](http://ifdb.tads.org/dladviser?id=xxzy1f49yw1n6ghj).

Data collected from the online plays of the story was used to analyze some common patterns and improving the parser version. Those statistics and other discussion of the game can be found from the [Undo Restart Restore blog](http://nitku.net/blog/tag/starborn-2/).
